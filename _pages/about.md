I am a Ph.D student from the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xiapu Luo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/). I am also fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) and [Prof. Yepang Liu](https://yepangliu.github.io/). Before coming to Polyu, I obtained my B.Eng degree in the School of Computer, Wuhan University.

My research interests are but not limited to program analysis, system security, mobile security, software ecosystem analysis, HCI and Big data-driven Analysis.
